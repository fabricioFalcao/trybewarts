# Trybewarts Form

## Description
In this project, you will develop a feedback form page for Trybewarts School of Magic, where students can submit their feedback. The theme of this project is based on J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series, as programming is the closest we can get to something truly magical! However, no prior knowledge of the original work is required, as this is a unique version of the School of Witchcraft with all the necessary information provided in this README!
